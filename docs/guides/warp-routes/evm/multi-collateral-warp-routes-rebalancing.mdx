title: "HWRs 2.0 Rebalancing"
---

A **Hyperlane Warp Routes (HWR) 2.0** is a way to bridge multiple existing tokens across different chains while maintaining liquidity. Instead of introducing a new synthetic asset for every transfer, it allows chains to leverage existing token liquidity in a structured manner.

This is useful when expanding to new chains, ensuring users have access to assets that already exist in the ecosystem. The diagram below shows a setup where canonical USDC exists on Base and Arbitrum, with a synthetic HWR created on a new chain.

```mermaid
flowchart
    subgraph base
    BU((User))
    BWR[USDC Collateral HWR]
    end

    subgraph arbitrum
    AU((User))
    AWR[USDC Collateral HWR]
    end

    subgraph newchain
    NWR[USDC Synthetic HWR]
    Recipient((Recipient))
    end

    BU -- "transferRemote(newchain,<br>recipient, amount)" --> BWR
    BWR -. "{recipient, amount}" .-> NWR
    AU -- "transferRemote(newchain,<br>recipient, amount)" --> AWR
    AWR -. "{recipient, amount}" .-> NWR
    NWR -. "2 \* amount" .-> Recipient
```

### Collateral Imbalances

If more funds flow in one direction, one of the chains in the route can run out of collateral. This _imbalanced flow_ prevents withdrawals until the collateral is covered.

```mermaid
flowchart
	subgraph base
		BWR[USDC Collateral HWR]
	end

	subgraph arbitrum
		AWR[USDC Collateral HWR]
	end

	subgraph newchain
		NWR[USDC Synthetic HWR]
		NU((Recipient))
	end

	NU -- "transferRemote(arbitrum,<br> recipient, 2 * amount)" --> NWR
	NWR -. "{recipient, 2 * amount}" .-> AWR
```

To fix this and maintain a good user experience, we must perform _collateral rebalancing_; collateral may need to be moved between chains or sourced from local inventory to restore balance. An aligned actor may assume a traditional Liquidity Provider (LP) role and provide collateral to address these imbalances using their inventory.

## Liquidity Provider

Currently, Hyperlane Warp Routes 2.0 donâ€™t have an explicit liquidity provider interface that enables local deposits/withdrawals. However, LPs can manually manage liquidity using the [Hyperlane CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hyperlane-xyz/cli) or the UI to interact with the HWRs in the [Hyperlane registry](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-registry).

<Warning>
  The stopgap procedure defined below requires at least one synthetic chain to
  exist within the HWR topology.
</Warning>

- To inspect a HWRs topology, use the `warp read` command:

```
hyperlane warp read --symbol ETH

ethereum:
    type: native
    ...
base:
    type: native
    ...
bsc:
    type: synthetic
    ...
```

- To send a transfer (`transferRemote`) on a HWR, use the `warp send` command:

```
hyperlane warp send \
	--symbol ETH \
	--origin base \
    --destination bsc \
	--amount <AMOUNT> \
	--recipient <ADDRESS>
```

### Depositing Liquidity

LPs can deposit collateral via a `transferRemote` where:

- `destination` domain is a chain where the HWRs has a `synthetic` type
- `recipient` address is controlled by the LP
- `amount` is liquidity denominated in the `origin` chains `collateral` token

```mermaid
flowchart
	LP((Liquidity Provider))

	subgraph arbitrum
		AWR[USDC Collateral HWR]
		AUSDC[USDC]
	end

	subgraph mychain
		MWR[USDC Synthetic HWR]
	end

	AWR -- "transferFrom(LP, amount)" --> AUSDC
	LP -. "amount" .-> AWR
	LP -- "transferRemote(newchain,<br>LP, amount)" --> AWR

	AWR -. "{LP, amount}" .-> MWR
	MWR -. "amount" .-> LP
```

This can be done by providing liquidity on many collateral chains and representing a claim on each collateral with a single synthetic asset balance.

### Withdrawing Liquidity

LPs can withdraw via a `transferRemote` where

- `destination` domain is a chain where the HWR is a `collateral` type
- `recipient` address is controlled by the LP
- `amount` is denominated in the `destination` chains `collateral` token

```mermaid
flowchart
	LP((Liquidity Provider))

	subgraph arbitrum
		AWR[USDC Collateral HWR]
		AUSDC[USDC]
	end

	subgraph mychain
		MWR[USDC Synthetic HWR]
	end

	LP -- "transferRemote(arbitrum,<br>LP, amount)" --> MWR
	LP -. "amount" .-> MWR

	MWR -. "{LP, amount}" .-> AWR
	AWR -- "transfer(LP, amount)" --> AUSDC
	AWR -. "amount" .-> LP
```
