title: "Overrides"
---

Interchain Accounts allow developers to override the default chains and security models configured in the `InterchainAccountRouter`.

These are useful for:

- Calling an ICA on chains not configured in `InterchainAccountRouter`.
- Using different ISM than the defaults configured in the `InterchainAccountRouter`
- Adjusting the gas limit for IGP payments or setting other parameters.

## Interface

The `callRemoteWithOverrides` function looks similar to the `callRemote` function, but takes three additional arguments.

First, developers can override `_router`, the address of the `InterchainAccountRouter` on the remote chain. This allows developers to control an ICA on remote chains that have not been configured on the local `InterchainAccountRouter`.

Second, developers can override `_ism`, the address of the remote interchain security module (ISM) used to secure their ICA. This ISM will be used to verify the interchain messages passed between the local and remote `InterchainAccountRouters`. This allows developers to use a custom security model that best suits their needs.

Third, developers can override `_hookMetadata`, the [StandardHookMetadata](/docs/reference/developer-tools/libraries/hookmetadata) metadata passed to the message hooks for each ICA call (for example, overriding the gas limit for the IGP payment).
