Hyperlane Warp Routes 2.0 are a type of Hyperlane Warp Route (HWR) that allows liquidity to be sourced from multiple collateral chains.

## Overview

In a single-collateral HWR, tokens are locked on one source chain.

Example:

- Lock 100 USDC on Ethereum
- Mint 100 USDC on NewChain

Hyperlane Warp Routes 2.0, on the other hand, allows users to bridge from multiple collateral chains.

Example:

- Lock 50 USDC on Base
- Lock 50 USDC on Arbitrum
- Mint 100 USDC on NewChain

This setup allows a destination chain to receive assets from multiple sources, making it easier for users to onboard liquidity without depending on a single origin.

## High-level Flowchart

```mermaid

    subgraph base
    BU((User))
    BWR[USDC Collateral HWR]
    end
    subgraph arbitrum
    AU((User))
    AWR[USDC Collateral HWR]
    end
    subgraph newchain
    NWR[USDC Synthetic HWR]
    Recipient((Recipient))
    end
    BU -- "transferRemote(newchain,<br>recipient, amount)" --> BWR
    BWR -. "{recipient, amount}" .-> NWR
    AU -- "transferRemote(newchain,<br>recipient, amount)" --> AWR
    AWR -. "{recipient, amount}" .-> NWR
    NWR -. "2 \* amount" .-> Recipient
```

<Warning>
  Since liquidity can come from multiple sources, balancing collateral across
  chains is important to ensure a smooth user experience. Currently, teams must
  rebalance manually. Automated solutions aim to streamline this.
