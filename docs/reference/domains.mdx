## Core Domains

This list includes only the deployments on chains that are managed by Abacus Works (our legal entity). Anybody can deploy Hyperlane on any chain [permissionlessly](/docs/guides/chains/deploy-hyperlane) - we are building a registry to reflect the community's permissionless deployments.

Hyperlane uses unique IDs for each Hyperlane-supported chain. When possible Hyperlane domain IDs match EVM chain IDs, but this is **not guaranteed** as we support non-EVM chains as well.

<Warning>
  Some Hyperlane domain IDs do not match their corresponding EVM chain IDs, such as:

- `immutablezkevmmainnet`
- `rarichain`
- `rootstockmainnet`
- `alephzeroevmmainnet`
- `chilizmainnet`
- `lumiaprism`
- `superpositionmainnet`
- `flowmainnet`
- `metal`
- `polynomialfi`

Please refer to the table below for the full list of Hyperlane domain IDs.

</Warning>

When sending a message, users must provide the domain ID of the destination chain. When [receiving a message](/docs/reference/messaging/receive), the recipient will be passed the domain ID of the origin chain.
