## Overview

Community ISMs are developed and maintained by the community. These ISMs extend Hyperlane's security capabilities with specialized verification logic, alternative trust models, or integration with external infrastructure. By using community ISMs, developers can implement custom security requirements while still benefiting from Hyperlane's messaging infrastructure.

When using a community ISM, developers should review the implementation and security properties to ensure they match their application's requirements.
