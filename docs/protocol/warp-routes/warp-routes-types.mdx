## Core HWR Types

### Native Token HWRs

Implemented in `HypNative.sol`, native HWR handle the transfer of native gas tokens (e.g. ETH on Ethereum or Arbitrum, MNT on Mantle) across different chains.

#### Features

- Directly transfers native tokens without wrapping.
- Uses `msg.value` for transfer amount.
- Handles excess `msg.value` as hook payment.
- Supports donations through a `receive()` function.

See [the implementation](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/HypNative.sol) for more details.

### Collateral-Backed ERC20 HWR

Implemented in `HypERC20Collateral.sol`, collateral HWR enable ERC20 tokens to be locked as collateral on the source chain and then used to mint a synthetic representation on the destination chain.

#### Features

- Wraps existing ERC20 tokens as collateral for transfers.
- Locks tokens in the contract on the source chain.
- Releases equivalent tokens on the destination chain.
- Uses SafeERC20 for secure token transfers.

See [the implementation](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/HypERC20Collateral.sol) for more details.

### Synthetic ERC20 HWR

Implemented in `HypERC20.sol`, synthetic HWRs mint new tokens on the destination chain that represent the original tokens from the source chain. The original tokens are not transferred but remain locked.

#### Features[​](#features-2 "Direct link to Features")

- Maintains consistent total supply across all chains.
- Supports custom token attributes (name, symbol, decimals).
- Mints new tokens on the destination chain.
- Burns tokens on the source chain when transferred back.

See [the implementation](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/HypERC20.sol) for more details.

## Advanced Features[​](#advanced-features "Direct link to Advanced Features")

### TokenRouter functionality

All HWRs extend the `TokenRouter` contract, which provides the core functionality for HWR token transfers.

#### Features

1. **Message Structure**: Uses [TokenMessage](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/libs/TokenMessage.sol) library for encoding and decoding token transfer messages.

2. **Transfer Initiation**: `transferRemote` function initiates cross-chain transfers.

3. **Message Handling**: `_handle` function processes incoming transfer messages.

4. **Abstract Methods**:

   - `_transferFromSender`: Implemented by all HWRs to handle token collection.
   - `_transferTo`: Implemented by all HWRs to handle token distribution.

#### TokenMessage Format

```
[32 bytes for recipient][32 bytes for amount][remaining bytes for metadata]
```

This standardized format ensures consistent handling across different HWR implementations while allowing for extensibility through metadata.

See [the implementation](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/libs/TokenRouter.sol) for more details.

### FastTokenRouter Transfers

Implemented in `FastTokenRouter.sol`, this router extends TokenRouter and provides faster token transfers through a liquidity provider mechanism.

#### Features

- Allows liquidity providers to fulfill transfer requests before message processing.
- Includes a `fastFee` to incentivize liquidity providers.
- Introduces `fastTransferId` for unique transfer identification.

See [the implementation](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/libs/FastTokenRouter.sol) for more details.

## Specialized HWR Extensions

### 1. Fast Collateral Transfers (FastHypERC20Collateral)

- Combines fast transfer capabilities with collateral-backed ERC20 functionality.
- See [the implementation](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/extensions/FastHypERC20Collateral.sol) for more details.

### 2. Vault Integration (HypERC4626OwnerCollateral, HypERC4626Collateral)

- Allows for yield generation on collateral by integrating with ERC-4626 vaults.
- See [the implementation](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/extensions/HypERC4626OwnerCollateral.sol) & [rebasing variant](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/extensions/HypERC4626Collateral.sol) and for more details.

### 3. Fiat-Backed Tokens (HypFiatToken)

- Designed for stablecoins and other fiat-backed tokens, implementing specific mint and burn operations.
- See [the implementation](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/extensions/HypFiatToken.sol) for more details.

### 4. Scaled Native Tokens (HypNativeScaled)

- Scales native token values for consistency across chains with different decimals.
- See [the implementation](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/extensions/HypNativeScaled.sol) for more details.

### 5. xERC20 Integration (HypXERC20 & HypXERC20Lockbox)

- Enables cross-chain transfers of xERC20 tokens, integrating with lockbox mechanisms for conversions.
- See the [HypXERC20 implementation](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/extensions/HypXERC20.sol) and the [HypXERC20Lockbox implementation](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/solidity/contracts/token/extensions/HypXERC20Lockbox.sol) for more details.
